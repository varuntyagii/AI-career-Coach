# ✅ All Issues Fixed - Final Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: "Thank you for your message! Your email client will open..." message was appearing and opening external email client instead of showing a modal popup.

**Root Cause**: The Support page (`app/(main)/support/page.jsx`) was using `mailto:` links and `window.location.href` to open external email clients.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

- **File**: `app/(main)/support/page.jsx`

  - ✅ Replaced inline form with "Open Contact Form" button
  - ✅ All contact actions use modal popup

### 2. **Footer - Mail Icon** ✅
- **File**: `components/footer.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - ❌ Removed `mailto:` link from Mail icon
  - ✅ Mail icon now opens ContactForm modal
  - ✅ All social links open in new tabs (except Mail)

### 3. **Contact Form Modal** ✅
- **File**: `components/contact-form.jsx`
- **Status**: Already created and working
- **Features**:
  - ✅ EmailJS integration
  - ✅ Modal popup (no external browser)
  - ✅ Toast notifications
  - ✅ Form validation
  - ✅ Loading states

## 🚀 How It Works Now

3. **Support Page → "Email Support" card** → Opens modal ✅
4. **Support Page → "Open Contact Form" button** → Opens modal ✅
